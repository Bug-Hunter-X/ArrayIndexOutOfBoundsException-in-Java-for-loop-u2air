# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java programming: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The error occurs when the program attempts to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range of indices for that array. In Java, array indices start at 0 and end at length - 1.

The `bug.java` file contains code that produces this exception. The `bugSolution.java` file shows the corrected code.
